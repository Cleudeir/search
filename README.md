## Summary

This project, `search_next`, is a Next.js application (version 13.1.1) designed to provide search functionality for movies and TV shows. It uses TypeScript for type safety and includes features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for performance optimization.  The application fetches data from a backend API and the TMDB API, providing users with a searchable list of movies and TV shows, with detailed information and video playback for individual items.  The frontend uses custom components for display, navigation, and search.  The backend API handles data management, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data.  Error handling and data validation are implemented to ensure application stability. The project includes comprehensive documentation for the codebase.
